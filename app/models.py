# Association table for the "followers" relationship between users.
# This table implements a many-to-many relationship where:
# - one user can follow many other users
# - and one user can be followed by many users
# We use a plain Table (not a db.Model) because this table only stores
# the relationship itself and does not need its own model class.

    "followers",  # The actual name of the table in the database
    db.metadata,  # Registers this table in the application's metadata
    # (so that db.create_all() knows to create it)
    # The ID of the user who is following someone

        sa.ForeignKey("user.id"),  # references user.id

# Notes:
# - Both columns together form a composite primary key.
#   This means each (follower_id, followed_id) pair must be unique.
# - A user can follow multiple users, and be followed by multiple users.
# - You must define this table ABOVE the User model in models.py,
#   because the User model will reference it later.
